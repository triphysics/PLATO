# Phonon State Moments Calculator
This repository contains a Python script to calculate the moments of phonon states based on the phonon density of states (DOS) data. The script loads the phonon DOS from "outfile.phonon_dos," calculates moments for the overall case, Mg, and O, and prints the results.

## Usage

Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python Cophonicity.py
