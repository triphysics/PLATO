# PLATO: Phonon LAttice TOols a place for all lattice dynamics and thermal transport related tools.

1. Tdep_helping_Tools my set of tools I wrote few years back to work with TDEP output files. Check README.md inside directory to find out more.
 

2. Cophonicity provides a simple way to quantify phonon DOS overlap in a material. see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cophonicity and reference therein for more details. This is been tested with TDEP code but should work with all existing codes.
