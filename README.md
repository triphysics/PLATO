# PLATO: Phonon LAttice TOols a place for all lattice dynamics and thermal transport related tools.

1. Tdep_helping_Tools my set of tools I wrote few years back to work with TDEP output files. Check README.md inside directory to find out more.
 
2. Atom_Projected_Phonon_Dispersion provies a way to resolve the phonon dispersion in terms of atomic contributions.
