# Group Velocity Projected Phonon Dispersion Plotter

This Python script reads the phonon dispersion data from a TDEP output file named "outfile.dispersion_relations.hdf5" and projects the average phonon group velocities onto the phonon dispersion.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, make sure the following prerequisites are met:

1. Ensure that the "outfile.dispersion_relations.hdf5" file is present in the working directory. This file should contain the phonon dispersion data as generated by TDEP.

## Usage

```
python tdep_phonon_with_gv.py --cmap jet 
```

## Command Line Options

The script supports the following command line options:

- `--f`: Specify the filename containing phonon frequencies and group velocities. Default is "outfile.dispersion_relations.hdf5".
- `--cmap`: Use cmap plot mode with the specified colormap. Default is "cool".
- `--alpha`: Use transparency to improve plots. Useful when a large number of bands are present. Default is 0.6.
- `--gnuplot`: Write output data to a file.
- `--format`: Specify the output file format. Default is "png".
- `--width`: Specify the width of the figure. Default is 6.
- `--height`: Specify the height of the figure. Default is 4.
- `--ymax`: Specify the maximum y-axis limit in THz.

## Output

The script generates a plot showing the phonon dispersion with projected average group velocities. The color of each point on the plot represents the magnitude of the group velocity.

If the `--gnuplot` option is used, the script also writes distance, frequency, and normalized amplitude data for each atom to a separate file.
