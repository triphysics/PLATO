# Mode Gruneisen projected phonon dispersion plotter

This Python script reads the phonon dispersion data from a TDEP output file "outfile.dispersion_relations.hdf5"
and project the mode_gruneisen on phonon dispersion.

## Prerequisites:
    1. Ensure that the "outfile.dispersion_relations.hdf5" file is present in the working directory, containing the
       phonon dispersion data as generated by TDEP.
    2. Make sure to run tdep phonon calculation with --gruneisen  option. Note this also requires 
       infile.forceconstant_thirdorder file.
 
## Usage:
    Simply run the script in a directory containing the "outfile.dispersion_relations.hdf5" file to generate the plot.

```
python3 tdep_phonon_with_mode_gruneisen.py --cmap jet
```
