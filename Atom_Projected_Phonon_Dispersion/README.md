# Atom-Projected Phonon Dispersion Plotter

This Python script reads phonon dispersion data from a phonopy output file "band.yaml" and plots the atom-projected phonon dispersion using the corresponding eigenvectors. The script provides options to generate scatter plots and colormap (cmap) plots for visualizing the atom contributions to the phonon modes.

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure that the "band.yaml" file is present in the working directory, containing the phonon dispersion data as generated by the phonopy package.
2. This version best works for simple diatomic structures.

## Features

1. Load phonon dispersion data from the "band.yaml" file.
2. Extract eigenvectors representing atom-projected contributions.
3. Normalize amplitudes of eigenvectors for visualization.
4. Plot atom-projected phonon dispersion using scatter plots or colormap plots.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies: `numpy`, `matplotlib`.
2. Place the "band.yaml" file in the working directory. YbS band.yaml file is supplied with the code.
3. Run the script using the following command:

```shell
python your_script.py [--scatter] [--cmap COLORMAP] [--gnuplot] [--atom1_label LABEL] [--atom2_label LABEL]
